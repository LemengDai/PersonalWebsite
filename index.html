      <p>
        I am passionate about STEM subjects and Visual Arts. I have always had a deep interest in Sciences since I was small. I love reading science fiction and articles about recent technological or scientific advancements. In recent years, I got especially interested in computer science and engineering. So I want a future career in those fields. I am really passionate about cutting-edge technologies and desire to see or even get involved in the foremost edge of science. For Visual Arts, I started drawing and instantly fell in love with it when I was in kindergarten. Later on, I studied sketching and gouache painting for eight years.

          <p>
            I used the Pygame module of Python to create the game for the create task of 2020 AP CSP. It is a remake of a game called Flappy Bird. The player needs to control the bird to move through gaps between pipes, the player loses if the bird collides with the pipes or the ground. The video illustrates that the player can make the bird fly upwards by pressing the up key, otherwise the bird would drop to the ground and therefore the player loses. The bird needs to fly through the pipes, flying through each pair of pipes worth one point. In the end, the player can replay the game by pressing the enter key.

          <p>
            I created this smart security system with the Raspberry Pi. It is used to see a visitor when the house's door is closed. Whenever a visitor rings the bell, an image of the visitor is captured by the camera and then sent to the email address of the house's owner. The owner then can go to a website where he/she can choose to unlock the door or keep the door locked.

          <p>
            I participated the virtual QCSYS of 2020. Quantum Cryptography School for Young Students(QCSYS) was held by the University of Waterloo to teach maths, physics and cryptography knowledge required for studying the basics of quantum cryptography. I have a deep interest in STEM subjects, so it was an interesting and challenging experience.

      <p class="title3">Leonardo da Vinci</p>
      <p>
        When people talk about inspirational engineers, they might mention people like Elon Musk and Steve Jobs. I definitely admire them a lot. However, the engineer who brings me the most inspiration is Leonardo da Vinci, which might sound strange. He is most famous for his drawings, but he finally became my role model because he is a literal combination of science, art and engineering. I want to become someone like him who has interests and works in multidiscipline, someone who has both a precise attitude towards science and unlimited creativity.

            The book was written by David Hu, which talks about the remarkable mechanics behind animal locomotion, as well as the robots and devices that are inspired by animal mechanics. This is the book that makes me determined for engineering. I want to be part of the creation process of innovative projects and it does not matter if I am the engineer who designs and builds them or the programmer who programs them.
